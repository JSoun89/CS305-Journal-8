#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? 

The client is Artemis Financial, the issue that was addressed was adding more security to the current application. 

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did well with communicating with the team to ensure that the security problem is resolved. It is important to code securely because the clients information could be used in a negative way by the public. Therefore, it is very important to code securely to ensure that client information is kept private. 

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I think that generating the certificate was the most challenging for me. 

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensure that the application was functional by running the software often to ensure that no errors are found. By doing so the software will ensure that no vulnerabilities will pop up. 

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

One of the source I used the most and will continue to use is stack overflow. Also, I watched a few youtube videos on how other people would try to resolve certain problems. This helped me when I needed to see step by step help. 

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

 
I would show the project 2 assignment to my future employers.
